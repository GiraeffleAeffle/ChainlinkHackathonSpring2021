# Reduction of Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through incentivization

## Goal: Automate carbon tax, increasing transparency, security, and speed.

## Approaches

### Idea 1: Companies stake capital on reward/penalized base

Staking between companies acts as incentive to reduce emissions
- Those whose relative emissions increase over time are penalized
- Those whose relative emissions decrease over time are rewarded

#### Pro
- Has direct incentive, because companies most likely reinvest money into renewable energies with less emissions to be still eligible for rewards
- Competition between companies?

#### Con
Unclear what happens if all the participants have a low carbon emission
General public doesnâ€™t get benefits from it, because it is reinvested only in the company.
Harder to implement?

### Idea 2: Have companies stake and compete for rewards based on their emissions

For example two companies are given a quarter year to reduce GHG to a relative amount. The one that manages to reduce their GHG more will get the stake of the other company.


### Idea 3: Governance protocol decides the spending

Proof of Humanity to reduce manipulation (sybil resistance), also the proper citizens vote for their local expenditure

#### Pro
- Local communities could directly vote for carbon-emission related projects. 
- Fairest?  Option on what to do with newly taxed money
- Easier to implement?
#### Con
- Democracy is very slow.
- Potential disputes about funding of projects.

### Additional: NFT- additional reputation layer on top of the already transparent emissions.
